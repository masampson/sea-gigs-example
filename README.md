SeaGigs was founded in 2021 as a source for Seattle based concert listings. Users could search by bands and venues to find concert listings, as well as submit their own events to be listed. We operated for about 6 months before begin approached by Showlist LLC, a larger and more widespread service of a similar nature, and after reaching an agreement we have folded SeaGigs into Showlist and joined their operation team.

I was the solo developer for SeaGigs, building the site using Next.js and utilizing Cosmic as a headless CMS. A fascimile of the operational site can be found here:
